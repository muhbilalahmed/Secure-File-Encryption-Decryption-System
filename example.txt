Secure File Encryption Decryption System

This program is a simple implementation of a symmetric encryption system using the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES). It provides a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to encrypt and decrypt files using a single key, which must be securely shared between the Encryption and Decryption. The program eliminates the need for public-key cryptography, focusing solely on symmetric key management, making it straightforward and efficient for use cases where both parties can securely exchange the key.

The core of the program revolves around the cryptography library, which is used to handle encryption and decryption operations. The Encryption generates a 256-bit AES key and saves it to a file. This key is then used to encrypt a selected text file. The resulting encrypted file is saved with a .enc extension. This encrypted file and the key file can then be shared with the intended recipient securely.

When the recipient receives the encrypted file, they load the file along with the corresponding key file using the program. The program then decrypts the encrypted file using the AES key and saves the decrypted content as a new file with a _decrypted.txt suffix. This process ensures that only someone with access to the correct key can decrypt and read the file's contents.

The program's simplicity and ease of use make it suitable for scenarios where secure file transfer is needed, but public key infrastructure (PKI) is not available or necessary. However, the security of the system relies heavily on the safe distribution and storage of the symmetric key. If the key is exposed or intercepted, the security of the encrypted data is compromised.
